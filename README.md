# TFT Teambuilder POC
A team builder app for Teamfight tactics, set 12.

![Screenshot of App](/images/screenshot.png "Screenshot of app")

This app is a simple POC for making a team builder app for Teamfight Tactics on mobile.

Websites such as [tactics.tools](https://tactics.tools/) and [Meta Tft](https://www.metatft.com/)
exist already as web apps that have this implementation. I just wanted to see if I could recreate 
the functionality in an Android app.

I am used an html version of tactics.tools on Set 12 (since I could not find the unit data in
Riot's API at the time).

### Drag and Drop

Experimental branch for showing drag and drop features, does not seem to work well with other click methods,
so leaving it here
